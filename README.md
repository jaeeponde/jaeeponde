### Hi there, I am Jaee!

My code compiles sometimes and then I upload it here  


- I am currently interested in computational biology, genomics and bioinformatics

- Exploring Machine Learning applications on biological datasets

- Python, C, R & MATLAB

- Building models to simulate biological processes mathematically

- All my projects and courseworks can be found in the repositories :)
